        An Interactive Art Director student at Hyper Island dying to solve hard problems together with thoughtful, pragmatic and curious people.

      I love the complexity and challenge it takes to design human-centered, meaningful products. And I write code and design pretty interfaces simply because I can't help myself.

        For the last few years I've worked as a photographer and a designer. In my spare time I enjoy meta-conversations, playing the guitar, libanese food and writing lists. I also currently live in a co-living Tech Home with 13 other creators, builders and hackers in the Old Town of Stockholm.

         I love the complexity and challenge it takes to design human-centered, meaningful products. And I write code and design pretty interfaces simply because I can't help myself.

          Foolishly idealistic heart but pragmatic brain. Only trusts a design process that can be backed up by data and cannot stop questioning things. But I do love to dwell on an artsy fartsy visual treatment. 

          I crave solving hard problems together with thoughtful, pragmatic and curious people.
