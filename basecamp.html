        Reading Rework was a bit like choosing the red pill. Once you go rework, you don't go back. 
      </br></br> I first heard of Rework when listening to DHH at the Tim Ferriss show, and his way of thinking resonated so well with mine that I ordered the book the very same day.

        My favorite takeaways, that will hopefully be leading stars in the companies I work with in the future:

        Remote working is the way of living.

Why me?

        I'm an Interactive Art Director student at Hyper Island dying to solve some hard problems together with thoughtful, pragmatic and curious people. 

        I geek out on most parts of the design process; asking the right questions, understanding users, prototyping, the visual design (I love details), and writing front-end code. 
</br></br>
        At Hyper Island I’ve also learned how to work in diverse teams, becoming great at articulating ideas and reason around design. Hyper Island did another thing for me too (and probably more important): it made me convinced I did not want to do BS work. Being in a culture that promotes a pretty process over a meaningful result, and over-working rather than effective working, made me hungry for the opposite. 

</br></br>
        Before I got into design, I worked as a (people-) photographer for three years. I sometimes think this made me a more empathetic person, but it could also be the oposite. I currently live together with 13 other creators, builders and hackers in a co-living space in the Old Town of Stockholm (same here when it comes to empathy). </br></br>In my spare time I enjoy meta-conversations, data, playing the guitar, libanese food and philosophy.
