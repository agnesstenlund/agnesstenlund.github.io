Why Basecamp: or, how to design (and live life) without BS
    </h1>
      <h4 class="left-align">
        Ever since I was a kid, me and my father have had our own way of conversing; quickly, with curiousity, and always about ideas. My father had opinions and nuance to bring to every subject, and he would teach me the importance of critical thinking. Our discussions made me opinionated and articulate, and turned my black and white world beautifully gray.

      </br></br>
        This month, I'm finishing Hyper Island, a digital design school in Stockholm where I've been working with designers from all over the world on real briefs with real clients, in a fast-paced, team-focused environment. 
     
      </br></br>
        Going to Hyper Island has made me a better designer, team member, and possibly a better human—forcing me to constantly make decisions, learn new things and take myself less seriously. But maybe more importantly—Hyper Island has made it clear how I <i>don't</i> want to work.
     
     </br></br>  
    Being at a school where students spend a lot of time on busywork, pretty processes and more hours rather than better, has made me search for an alternative way of working. I'm sick of BS. BS assumptions and BS design processes. I wan't more critical thinking, more nuance, more experimenting and more data.

       </br></br>   
        This is why I want to work at Basecamp. 

      </br></br>
     After reading Rework, (the only book that I immedietly began rereading after just having finished it), I've become insanely curious about Basecamp and the way you work. I love the non-BS-only-do-what-actually-works-approach that resonates with my way of thinking and my discussions with my father. Richard Feynman said something which I think all human-centered designers (and people in general) should have in mind: <i>"It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong" </i>. 

   </br></br>
   I would love to work with you and push you with even more questioning, experimenting and nuance (+ make some stunning interactive interfaces).

       </br></br>  Simply put, I would love to get real with you.

A bit more about me
    </h1>
                  <h4 class="left-align">

        I geek out on most parts of the design process; asking the right questions, understanding users, prototyping, the visual design and front-end development. Before getting into design I worked as a photographer. Even though I'm quite sceptical, I'm a really happy person by default.
